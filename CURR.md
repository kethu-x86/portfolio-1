# Personal Portfolio Overview

## Content overview

This React-based portfolio website serves as a personal showcase for Deepak PV. Content-wise, the single-page application is structured into comprehensive sections:

- **Hero**: A welcoming landing view.
- **About**: A brief introduction to the developer.
- **Projects**: Seamlessly presents key featured projects such as 'zeroW' (a food-wastage reduction app built with Flutter, Firebase, Python) and 'Chai Roaster' (a playful hackathon web app built with React/Vite).
- **Skills**: Details a well-rounded skillset that encompasses Programming & Systems (C, Java, Python, React, Flutter, etc.) as well as Soft Skills like Thinking & Communication and Growth & Leadership.
- **Contact**: Easy ways to reach out.

## Theme & Styling

The website features a modern, premium dark-themed aesthetic designed for visual excellence.

- **Colors**: The primary background is a deep charcoal (`#0A0A0A`), paired with card backgrounds of slightly lighter dark matte (`#121212`). The primary text is bright white (`#FFFFFF`) with secondary text in a muted gray (`#A1A1A1`). For dynamic highlights, the theme features vibrant accent colors: accent-blue (`#3B82F6`), accent-purple (`#8B5CF6`), and accent-green (`#10B981`).
- **Gradients**: A custom hero gradient provides a sleek look: `linear-gradient(135deg, #0A0A0A 0%, #0f0f1a 50%, #0A0A0A 100%)`.
- **Typography**: The typography implements Google Fonts to provide a clean, modern blend. It uses **'Inter'** for a legible body text, **'Poppins'** for bold and striking headings, and **'JetBrains Mono'** for monospace elements like code or specific tech tags.
- **Animations & Micro-interactions**: The user experience is highly dynamic and alive. It leverages **Framer Motion** and **GSAP** for fluid entry and exit animations. Custom CSS keyframe animations bring elements to life, including:
  - `float`: Smooth vertical floating (6s) to create an airy feeling.
  - `pulse-glow`: Dynamic glowing box-shadows (2s) bouncing between blue and purple accents to draw attention.
  - `gradient-shift`: Background position shifting on gradients (4s) for an organic, moving backdrop.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: The scrolling experience is elevated using `@studio-freight/lenis`, which provides buttery-smooth scroll interpolation, making navigation between sections feel much more fluid.

Overall, the styling is built with **Tailwind CSS**, making use of rich, curated color palettes, smooth gradient transitions, and highly interactive animations that collectively result in a stunning first impression and an engaging portfolio experience.
